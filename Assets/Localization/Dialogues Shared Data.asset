      in a town square and fell into a well... only it wasn't filled with water,
      but a secret cave filled with pirate chests brimming with gold. I was able
      to pay off my church debt from studies in painting, and even afford a new home
      for my father, who was still a farmer. You should have seen his expression
      when I told him he'd finally be able to own his own land and have servants
      after a lifetime of servitude. That must have been quite a sight, wouldn't
      you agree? Oh... I'm sorry, I can see you're in a hurry. I'll stop talking

      to earn coins. To start, ring that bell over there. Fight through multiple
      rounds. If you survive all the rounds, you keep your coins. But be careful,
      if you lose or hit the arena's edge, you'll lose all your coins. It's a fun
      way to test your fighting skills. Go ahead! Try it out.
