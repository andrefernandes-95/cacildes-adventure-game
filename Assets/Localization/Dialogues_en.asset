    m_Localized: Ah, a newbie. Very well. The arena is where you'll fight waves of
      enemies to earn coins. To start, ring that bell over there. Fight through multiple
      rounds. If you survive all the rounds, you keep your coins. But be careful,
      if you lose or hit the arena's edge, you'll lose all your coins. It's a fun
      way to test your fighting skills. Go ahead! Try it out.

      one. We use it to train. Even participate against each other. You can't die
      in the arena, but you do lose your coin if you lose. It's a harmless, yet fun
      way to pass time.

      orc.

    m_Localized: Switching the stones. Yes. I remember. The elves, with the orc stone,
      have benefited from his powerful magic, even if its darkness has caused them
      to seclude themselves in their forests. And the orcs, in their own darkness,
      perhaps have found a way to build their community and attain peace, in their
      own manner. A need for balance, you could say.

      They're... away on a diplomatic sojourn. Much needed, I assure you. This orc

      alliances abroad. Certainly not funded by the realm's coffers, I can assure
      you. (chuckles awkwardly, then quickly changes the subject) Don't you have...
      knightly work to do?
