    m_Localized: Ah, a newbie. Very well. The arena is where you'll fight waves of
      enemies to earn coins. To start, ring that bell over there. Fight through multiple
      rounds. If you survive all the rounds, you keep your coins. But be careful,
      if you lose or hit the arena's edge, you'll lose all your coins. It's a fun
      way to test your fighting skills. Go ahead! Try it out.

      way to pass time.

      my brothers, I did not take pleasure in the tormenting of souls. So, they kicked
      me out. I've been living with you mortals ever since. After dwelling here for

      perhaps have found a way to build their community and attain peace, in their
      own manner. A need for balance, you could say.
