      "The Dodge
      Roll" (Space / Circle Button)


      Picture this: Swinging blades are dangling
      right in front of you. What''s the plan? Definitely not strolling straight
      into them! But that''s exactly what Sir Elloyd did, and he swiftly became a
      sliced-up sandwich (I''m sure the goblins in that cave appreciated the extra
      filling).


      What should he have done? A forward roll. In the magical
      world of games, a forward roll usually means nothing hit you, even if it looked
      like it did.'

      m_Items: []
  - m_Id: 4306019319414784
    m_Localized: 'How to forward roll? Hit the Space key on your keyboard, or the
      Circle button on your trusty gamepad. You need to be moving while doing the
      dodge, otherwise you''ll backstep if standing still (more on that one later).


      Facing
      any direction will do. Just make sure you''re on the move. You''ll dodge spells,
      projectiles, and even the occasional sneeze from those foul goblins.



      Dodging
      uses a bit of your stamina, so investing some points in Endurance might not
      be a bad idea. It''s worth noting that boosting endurance also fortifies your
      overall physical defense. So, even if you occasionally miss your dodge timing,
      having a tougher shell can save your bacon!'

      "Backsteps" (Space / Circle Button

      Once upon a time, a dancer faced a giant troll,
      reasons unknown. Her opponent''s foot stomps were heavy but slow. With each
      smelly troll step, she gracefully backstepped away, evading every hit with
      agility.


      The troll, exhausted and intrigued by the dancer''s skill,
      thought she appeared impressive and decided to mimic her movements. However,
      the troll forgot that behind him was nothing but air and a one-way ticket downward,
      so his backstep turned into his final step.'

      move.


      Although it makes you look cool, a backstep doesn''t offer invulnerability
      (at least we haven''t seen it in other video games, but we could be wrong),
      so use it wisely!'

      "Know
      Your Enemy" (No input necessary)


      Once upon a time, Sir Clueless charged
      headfirst into battle, completely unaware that his enemy could follow up attacks
      with additional strikes.



      Sir Clueless dodged one attack but was taken
      aback as his foe continued their assault, delivering a surprising blow out
      of nowhere. This forced Sir Clueless to instinctively dodge yet again.'

      So what''s the
      take away? Dodging becomes simpler when you understand your enemy''s attack
      patterns. So, don''t rush in blindly the first time you meet a new adversary.
      Take your time. Just like all good things require practice, so does getting
      to know your enemies. Treat it like a dance, get to know their moves. Who knows,

      power from the soil and water to source his knights'' mana costs. The king,
      after this revelation, ordered the mage to destroy his stone army. Alas, it

      Knight unveiled a massive axe he had kept hidden for such an occasion. With
      a powerful blow, the enemy's shield shattered, leaving him vulnerable and off-balance.

      I
      miss you terribly, and it''s been lonely without your wise advice to guide
      me through these strange times. You''re not the only one who needed a vacation
      from here.



      Anyway, I''ll tell you all about it when you return. Bring

    m_Localized: Today, I began an ambitious project assigned by Master Sculptor
      Eamon Alden himself. My hands are already sore, and my mind feels overwhelmed,
      as I chip away at the gargoyle intended to guard the university of Veilglade.
      This task consumes me more than I expected. Each chisel strike and detail feels
      like a battle against my own limitations. It's more than just a job; it's a
      compulsion to create something extraordinary. There's a deep yearning within
      me, an ache for a creation that transcends mere stone.

      I cut my hand. I was so engrossed in my work that I didn't notice a drop of
      blood fall onto the gargoyle's stone face. To my shock, the stone seemed to
      shimmer where the blood touched. It was as if something mystical had been awakened.
      I am bewildered and unnerved. Did I imagine it, or have I accidentally infused
      my creation with something beyond my understanding?

      now gleam with an unsettling intelligence. It moves with a sinister grace,
      prowling the university's rooftops. The students and faculty speak in hushed,
      fearful tones of ominous signs. I am tormented by guilt. My creation has become
      a source of dread and chaos. I must find a way to fix this, to banish the nightmare
      I've unintentionally brought to life.

    m_Localized: A violent storm has engulfed Veilglade. The skies are ablaze with
      lightning, and thunder shakes the very ground. As I hide in my workshop, I
      see a glimmer of hope. The gargoyle is outside, exposed to the storm's fury.
      Could this tempest be my chance to undo the chaos? I worry for the university,
      but I hope nature's wrath might destroy the malevolent life I've inadvertently
      given to my creation.

    m_Localized: The storm has done its work. The gargoyle, struck by a bolt of lightning,
      has shattered into countless pieces. The explosion of stone was both a sight
      of grim relief and deep sorrow. Although the immediate threat is gone, the
      chaos it caused isn't entirely over. I'm left with a mix of relief and profound
      remorse. My creation, born of a single, accidental drop of blood, has met its
      end in a manner that is both tragic and eerily poetic.

      the gargoyle never came to life\u2014that it was all a figment of my fevered
      imagination. They say the storm was nothing more than a natural phenomenon,
      and the shattered stone was merely a consequence of its fury. Yet, the gargoyle
      remains on the rooftop, its stone eyes fixed upon me with a cold, unblinking
      stare.\n"

    m_Localized: As I stare up at the gargoyle, I cannot shake the feeling that something
      is amiss. The lines between reality and my vision seem to blur. Was it truly
      a dream, or did I conjure something from the depths of my own creation? The
      gargoyle's gaze, unmoving and eternal, seems to question me, challenging the
      very fabric of what I know to be real. As I drift off to sleep, I find myself
      trapped in a haunting ambiguity, forever caught between the realms of reality
      and the echoes of my own creation.

      It
      is with the utmost seriousness that I remind all members of the University
      community of the absolute prohibition against the study and practice of blood
      magic. This ancient and perilous discipline is strictly forbidden due to the
      severe consequences it inflicts on both the practitioner and those around them.
      Blood magic requires the sacrifice of one''s own vitality to harness its dark
      and formidable powers, often leading to irreversible physical and mental deterioration.'

      threatens the safety and integrity of our institution. Any involvement with
      blood magic or its associated texts, including the dangerously hidden tome
      "Bloodbound," will result in immediate expulsion and, if necessary, further
      disciplinary actions as deemed fit by the University Council. Guard your paths
      well, for the allure of such forbidden knowledge is a treacherous road to follow.
