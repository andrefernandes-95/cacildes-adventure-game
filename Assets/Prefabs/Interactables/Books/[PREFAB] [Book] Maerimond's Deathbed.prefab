  pageText: 'Maerimond was his name. In the tongue of elves, it means "one who shapes
    stones." Some say he met an accursed death and theorize that he will return as
    a vengeful spirit, lying in wait for an innocent footstep mistakenly taken towards
    that cavern.

    

    Those who pass through Snailcliff swear they hear stone
    steps echoing in the mountain''s rocks. What was once history has now become
    legend, and for some, it has transformed into a favorite tourist destination
    - the haunted road of Snailcliff.'

    The mage was ordered to travel with his stone army to a nearby cavern inhabited
    by bandits. \n\nAs they worked to clear the evil pillagers from the cavern, the
    place was sealed and buried with magic by the king's wizards. And so, the mage
    was imprisoned with his stone army, destined to slumber eternally beneath the
    bedrock of Snailcliff Mountain."
