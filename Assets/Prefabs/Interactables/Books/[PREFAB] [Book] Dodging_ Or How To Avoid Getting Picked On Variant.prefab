    valiant knight prepared to counter-attack. However, to his surprise, yet another
    hidden blow emerged from the lengthy combo. In that moment, Sir Clueless found
    himself truly clueless, and then he was dead.


    So what''s the take away?
    Dodging becomes simpler when you understand your enemy''s attack patterns. So,
    don''t rush in blindly the first time you meet a new adversary. Take your time.
    Just like all good things require practice, so does getting to know your enemies.
    Treat it like a dance, get to know their moves. Who knows, maybe they''ll get
    tired and leave you be. '

        "Backsteps"

        Once upon a time, a dancer,
        who had no reason to be on the battlefield, found herself facing a giant
        troll. Her opponent''s foot stomps were heavy but slow. With each smelly
        troll step, she gracefully backstepped away, evading every hit with agility.



        The
        troll, exhausted and intrigued by the dancer''s skill, thought she appeared
        impressive and decided to mimic her movements. However, the troll forgot
        that behind him was nothing but air and a one-way ticket downward, so his
        backstep turned into his final step.'

        some points in Endurance might not be a bad idea. It's worth noting that
        boosting endurance also fortifies your overall physical defense. So, even
